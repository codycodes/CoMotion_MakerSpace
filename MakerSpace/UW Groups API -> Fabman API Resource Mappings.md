## UW Groups API -> Fabman Resource Mappings

This is a document which contains a mapping of API calls we're using to transform resources between UW Groups API and Fabman's API.

## General Information
### Root URLS
UW Groups API Endpoint:  
https://iam-ws.u.washington.edu/group_sws/v3

Fabman API Endpoint:  
https://fabman.io/api/v1/

### API Docs:
[UW Groups API v3](https://iam-tools.u.washington.edu/apis/gws/)

[Fabman API v1](https://fabman.io/api/v1/documentation#/)

### Accessing API
TODO: adapt this to the language that we're going to use
`curl -u 'token:password' https://fabman.io/api/v1/members`
need to get api token by calling members to get memberId

## Resources


### Getting API token
Have to create it first by POSTing the target member ID to:

POST `/api-keys`

```
{
  "label": "azure-function-12-16-18",
  "member": memberId
}
```

GET `/api-keys/{id}/token` - response back is the token for Fabman
{id} will be given after POSTing

NOTE: API keys donâ€™t expire automatically. If you ever need to invalidate an API key, you can simply delete it.

### Adding members

### Adding members
#### [Add member to UW Group](https://iam-tools.u.washington.edu/apis/gws/#/Membership/putMember)
PUT `/group/{groupid}/member/{memberid}` - Used to put one or multiple members into the UW Group
#### [Add member to Fabman](https://fabman.io/api/v1/documentation#!/members/postMembers)
POST `/members` - Overall JSON data looks like the following. See [Get Members from UW Group and put them into Fabman](#Get-Members-from-UW-Group-and-put-them-into-Fabman) for the actual data we'll be passing in

## Transforms
### Get Members from UW Group and put them into Fabman

#### Uses [Adding members](#adding-members) resources

POST `/members`
```
{
  "space": 0,
  "memberNumber": "UW NETID",
"firstName":"UWNETID",
"emailAddress":"UWNETID@XXX",
  "account": 0
}
```

We can grab the User ID from the response. 

### Adding members as Administrators

TODO: Add getting admins from the specific admin user group -> ### Get Administrators from UW Groups and put them into Fabman. Ensure that we're able to get an email from the UW Group members

This occurs in Fabman:
First create a user in fabman that contains an emailAddress (admins must have email addresses)
POST `/members`
```
{
  "space": 0,
  "memberNumber": "UW NetID",
  "firstName": "UW NetID",
  "emailAddress": "test@domain.com",
  "account":0
}
```
Next we can assign the members privileges in Fabman, effectively making them "admin":
PUT `/members/{id}/privileges`
{id} is the memberId generated by Fabman

```
{
  "privileges": "admin"
}
```

NOTE: Administrators need to have emailAddress if there is no emailAddress then
"message": "Member needs an email address to be admin or owner"

### Get UW Groups' Groups and put them into Fabman
POST `/members/{id}/trainings`
id -> User ID
```
{
  "trainingCourse": ID of the training course
}
```

After created each member, assign them different trainings. 
`uw_comotion_makerspace_lasercutter` will be set pass the training `LaserCutter`. (Note: we need to find the trainingID from Fabman. 
`uw_comotion_makerspace_staff` will be `StaffTraining`.
`uw_comotion_makerspace_woodshop` will be `WoodshopTraining`.
